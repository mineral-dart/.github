### Command Handling

Commands in Mineral serve the purpose of defining specific actions that your bot can perform in response to a given command.

```dart
class HelloWorldCommand extends MineralCommand<GuildCommandInteraction> {
  HelloWorldCommand(): super(
    label: Display('hello'),
    description: Display('Add new member to the ticket !'),
    options: [
      CommandOption.user(Display('member'), Display('The member to add to the ticket !'))
    ]
  );

  Future<void> handle (interaction) async {
    final targetMember = interaction.getMember('member');

    await interaction.reply(
      content: 'Hello $targetMember',
      private: true
    );
  }
}
```

By utilizing events, you can create dynamic and interactive experiences within your Discord bot. 
Events allow you to capture and respond to various actions and changes happening in real-time, enabling your bot to adapt and provide relevant functionality based on the events occurring in the Discord environment.

```dart
class Ready extends MineralEvent<ReadyEvent> with Console {
  Future<void> handle (event) async {
    console.info('${event.client.user.username} is ready to use !');
  }
}
```

### Interactive Components

Events allow you to capture and respond to various actions and changes happening in real-time, enabling your bot to adapt and provide relevant functionality based on the events occurring in the Discord environment.

They allow users to interact with your bot directly within messages, enabling them to perform actions, make choices, and receive real-time feedback. Interactive components add an extra layer of interactivity to your bot's functionality and can greatly enhance the user experience.

Interactive components enhance the way buttons are used in Discord bots by introducing interactivity and real-time feedback.

A single file allows you to design your composanbt and attach a dedicated handler when the user interacts with it.

```dart
class MyButton extends InteractiveButton {
  MyButton(): super('my-id');

  @override
  Future<void> handle (ButtonCreateEvent event) async {
    await event.interaction.reply(
      content: 'Hello Mineral !', 
      private: true
    );
  }

  @override
  ButtonBuilder build () => ButtonBuilder.button(customId)
    ..setLabel('Mineral')
    ..setStyle(ButtonStyle.primary);
}
```

### State Management
Share and manage data across your bot using shared states.

```dart
class MyState extends MineralState<int> {
  MyState() : super(0);

  void increment() => state++;

  void decrement() => state--;
}
